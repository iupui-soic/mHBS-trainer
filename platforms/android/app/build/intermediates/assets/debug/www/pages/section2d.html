      <p><b>Wait at least 1 minute-and up to 3 minutes- to clamp or tie and cut the cord if the baby is receiving routine care. The baby receives needed blood from the placenta in the first minutes after birth.</b></p>
	  <p><b>Place two clamps or ties around the cord </b><br>
	  Place the first about 2 fingerbreadths from the baby’s abdomen. Place another about 5 fingerbreadths from the abdomen.</p>
	  <p><b>Cut between the clamps or ties with a disinfected scissors or blade</b><br>Look for any bleeding or oozing of blood.
If bleeding occurs, place a second clamp or tie between the first one and the baby’s skin. Leave the cut end of the cord open to the air to dry.
</p>
<p>Everything that touches the umbilical cord should be clean to avoid infection. Wear clean gloves when clamping or tying and cutting the cord.</p>
<p><b>Position the baby to encourage breastfeeding</b><br>lp the mother and baby initiate breastfeeding in the first hour after birth. Breastfeeding provides nutrition and helps prevent infection in the baby. Avoid any other feeding besides breast milk.
Keep mother and baby together. Small babies can benefit from special, prolonged skin-to-skin care (see <b>Essential Care for Small Babies</b>).</p>
<p>Continue with essential newborn care, identify the baby, and complete the birth record.</p>
