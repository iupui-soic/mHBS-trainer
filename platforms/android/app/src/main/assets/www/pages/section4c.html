	<p><b>If the heart rate is normal, continue to ventilate until the baby  is  breathing.</b><br>Look for the baby’s breathing. Stop ventilation when the baby is breathing and the heart rate stays normal.</p>
<p><b>If the heart rate is normal, but the baby is not breathing or is gasping, continue ventilation and re-evaluate breathing and heart rate.</b></p>
<p><b>If the heart rate  is slow,  make sure that you have taken all the steps to improve ventilation and re-evaluate breathing and heart rate.</b><br> A skilled helper can continuously evaluate chest rise and heart rate.</p>
<p><b>A baby who needs continued ventilation will need advanced care.</b><br>
Activate the emergency plan to seek consultation or advanced care at a specialty facility. Continue ventilation during transport if the baby will be moved for advanced care. If advanced care or suitable transport is not
available, discuss with parents and consider stopping ventilation after 20 minutes if heart rate is slow or the baby does not breathe.</p>

<p><b>If the baby has no heart rate and no breathing after giving ventilation for 10 minutes, the baby is dead.<br>
Stop ventilation.</b></p>

<p>Skin that is purple-white or peeling (maceration) suggests that a baby died long before birth. If recognized at birth, ventilation need not begin. Ventilation can be stopped whenever maceration is recognized.<br>
A baby who never had a heart rate and never breathed after birth is stillborn.</p>

	  <li>Decide on actions for normal and slow heart rate with and without breathing</li>
	  <li>Seek consultation to decide on advanced care</li>
