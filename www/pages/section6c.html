        <li><b>Trace each of the cases described on page 51 on the Action Plan.</b>
          Practice the questions you must ask and the actions you take in the
          correct order.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>Have another provider describe a case to you and give feedback.</b>
          Ask the evaluation questions. Your partner will answer by
          responding with the neonatal simulator or in words. Decide on
          the correct action. Perform the action. Ask the next evaluation
          question. Continue until the baby is breathing well or you decide
          on advanced care. Reflect on what you did and ask your partner for
          feedback (helpful suggestions to improve what you do).
        </li><br>
        <li><b>Review after helping a baby breathe.</b> Use the Action Plan as a
          guide to review your actions after helping a baby breathe. You can
          review by yourself and with other providers who assisted.<br>
          Ask these questions:<br>
          &#8208;What happened at the birth?<br>
          &#8208;Did you follow the Action Plan?<br>
          &#8208;What went well and what could have gone better?<br>
          &#8208;What did you learn from the case?<br>
          &#8208;What will you do differently next time?
        </li>
      </ul>
      Share your experiences with other birth attendants so you can learn
      from one another.
