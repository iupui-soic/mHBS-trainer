        Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
        direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
